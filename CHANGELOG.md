- [BUGFIX] Prevent animating child selection with CSS rather than clearing with JS so form inputs don't lose focus on each update. (#50)
- [BUGFIX] Switch the container to relative positioning on the render before the transitions start to avoid the glitch
  in Edge without using permanent relative positioning which is not an option. (#52)
- [DOCS] Add an example where the height transition is delayed until after the leave transition. (#43)

### v3.0.0 (27 August 2017)

##### Breaking change

- [FEATURE] The `isLeaving` prop is only added to children if opted in with `notifyLeaving={true}` since it's
  a departure from `react-transition-group` features.

##### Non-breaking changes

- [ENHANCEMENT] Treat a child rendering `null` as if there is no child; specifically helps avoid errors with RR4.
- [ENHANCEMENT] Maintain component callback refs by not overwriting with string refs similar to `react-transition-group`.
- [ENHANCEMENT] Use `requestAnimationFrame` to queue the height transition rather than a timeout.
- [ENHANCEMENT] Handle the enter and leave animation of changes due to successive child updates before the current transition ends.
- [ENHANCEMENT] Clear the selection after transitions to avoid the child being selected after multiple clicks.
- [ENHANCEMENT] Entering child renders with absolute positioning since switching from relative to abs on a premature leave cancels the active enter animation.
- [ENHANCEMENT] Fix enter animation of absolutely positioned elements in Chrome not working by skipping one animation frame in the Child component.
- [ENHANCEMENT] Fix Edge glitch when render starts by always applying container `position`, `display` (use a `div`) and `overflow` styles.
